# Folder-Maker

This Python script allows you to quickly create a new project folder having the following files:
    index.html --> Includes the default layout
    styles.css
    script.js

The script prompts you to enter a folder name, checks if the folder already exists, and creates the necessary files within the new folder.

How to Use
Run the script by executing the Python file (create_folder.py).
Enter the desired folder name when prompted.
The script checks if the folder already exists.
If not, it creates a new folder with default HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Folder Structure
index.html: Default HTML file with a basic template.
styles.css: Default CSS file with a placeholder comment.
script.js: Default JavaScript file with a placeholder comment.

How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed.
Run the script using python create_folder.py.
