# Folder-Maker

This Python script allows you to quickly create a new project folder with default HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The script prompts you to enter a folder name, checks if the folder already exists, and creates the necessary files within the new folder.

## How to Use
- Run the script by executing the Python file (create_folder.py).
* Enter the desired folder name when prompted.
+ The script checks if the folder already exists.
- If not, it creates a new folder with default HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## Folder Structure
`
FolderMaker\n
    │- README.md\n
    │- index.html: Default HTML file with a basic template.\n
    │- styles.css: Default CSS file with a placeholder comment.\n
    │- script.js: Default JavaScript file with a placeholder comment.\n
  `
## How to Run
Ensure you have Python installed.
Run the script using python create_folder.py.

> [!NOTE]
> Place the python file in the folder you want to save the files before running the code.

> [!TIP]
> if you want to add more files, you could just use `open()` func in the with statement after putting a comma `,`.
